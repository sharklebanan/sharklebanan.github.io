        <h1>Reasons why Murdle can go fuck himself</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>His "expose doc" actually sucks ass.</li>

          <p>(edit: "those guys" is the old roblox community. yes. you are not high on crack. that is actually what they said)</p>
          <li>He disregards minors' opinions with the excuse "they can't legally have them". What is this? A courtroom? Oh, it's a <b>Discord server relating to Old ROBLOX.</b></li>
          <li>He admits to simply having used Bamar for an arbiter. Lazy fat fuck.</li>
          <li>He used the nword hard r simply because he couldn't post in a Discord chat.</li>
          <li>He thinks he is better than everyone else simply because he has completed a few more laps of the Sun than them. I think he should <b>actually grow up</b>.</li>
